If you use version one, use SQL only for update so that objects already placed are not deleted.

1 - Added the ability to place doors. These can only be opened by the owner, or shared with friends using a command. The command is configurable in the config file.

2 - Added the ability to share ownership of a chest with a friend using the same command as for sharing doors.

3 - In the prompt to open the door or the chest, the ID appears so it can be used with the command to share ownership.

4 - Objects can now be rotated in all directions, allowing placement on inclined surfaces.

5 - The issue where some objects weren't recognized for deletion has been resolved
